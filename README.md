# Simple Calculator â€“ Python Project

This is a **basic Python calculator** program that can perform:  
- Addition (`+`)  
- Subtraction (`-`)  
- Multiplication (`*`)  
- Division (`/`) with **zero-division protection**  

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter two numbers.  
2. The user chooses an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
3. The program calculates and displays the result.  
4. If division by zero is attempted, it shows an error message instead of crashing.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Simple and beginner-friendly.
- Demonstrates how to take **user input** in Python.
- Shows the use of **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
- Includes **error handling** for division by zero.
